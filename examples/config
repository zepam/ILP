########## (1) 1st part of this file specifies UW policy:
# The standard instructional day is from 8:30 am to 6:20 pm.
InstructDayStartsAt = 8:30
InstructDayEndsAt = 18:20
Class-default-end-time = 16:50

# block scheduling affecting courses ending before 14:30
BlockSchedulingStartsAt = 8:30

# 10% rule applies to any given time per week (M-F numbers are combined).
# Right now, the percentage is 12%

# block scheduling requires the following starting time:
50-min-class-start-time = 8:30 9:30 10:30 11:30 12:30 13:30
80-min-class-start-time = 8:30 10:00 11:30 13:00

170-min-class-start-time = 8:30 11:30


####### (2) The second part specifies the constants and options we choose when forming the ILP problem.
# if the first variable is 1, we strictly follow the block policy (i.e., we set the X
# decision variables to 0 for any slots that do not meet the policy)
# if it is 0, then we do not set X, but the slot in CW with a penalty.
Must-follow-block-policy = 1
Penalty-for-violating-block-policy = -50

## if Treat-same-day-preference-as-hard-constraint is 1, instructors' same-day preference is treated as a hard constraint
# if Assume-same-day-if-not-specified, all the courses taught by same professor are assumed to be on the same day
Treat-same-day-preference-as-hard-constraint = 1
Assume-same-day-if-not-specified = 1

# lambdas for CW matrix and IW matrix
# UWPolicyWeight is set to 0 if must-follow-block-policy==1; set to 1 otherwise
UWPolicyWeight = 0
InstructorPrefWeight = 1
